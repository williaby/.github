# Centralized Community Health Files

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)

This repository contains shared community-health files that apply
organization-wide across all public repositories under the `williaby` GitHub
account. They ensure consistency, streamline onboarding,
and support best practices.

## Included Files

- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  
  Defines expected contributor behavior and enforcement procedures.

- [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)  
  Describes our vulnerability-reporting process, supported versions, and
- response timelines.

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)  
  Guides contributors through issue filing, pull-request workflow, DCO sign-off,
   and local setup.

- [`SUPPORT.md`](./SUPPORT.md)  
  Outlines support channels, prerequisites, SLAs, and community contributions.

- [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md)  
  Describes project roles, decision-making processes, and how governance can evolve.

- [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS)  
  Assigns default and path-specific code owners organization-wide.

- [`FUNDING.yml`](./FUNDING.yml)  
  Indicates our solo-practitioner stance and points to non-financial
  contribution paths.

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml`  
  Structured template for filing bug reports.

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.yml`  
  Structured template for proposing new features.

## How It Works

All of these files live in the `.github/` directory at the **organization**
level, so they automatically apply to every public repository (unless
overridden by a repo-specific copy).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork & Clone** this repo if you need to customize any file for a
     specific project.  
2. Review each file to see how it applies to your repository.  
3. If you maintain a repository that needs specialized adjustments, copy the
    relevant file into your repo’s root or `.github/` folder and tailor it accordingly.
